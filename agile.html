                <P>Agile testing is a software testing practice that follows the Agile software development methodology. In Agile development, projects tend to evolve during each sprint among collaborators and shareholders. Agile testing focuses on ensuring quality throughout the Agile software development process.

                  Continuous integration and continuous delivery are two important aspects of agile testing. In continuous integration, developers integrate their code changes into a shared mainline several times a day. In continuous delivery, every change that passes all tests is automatically released into production.Development teams can conduct Agile testing in several ways. The most common way is for Agile teams to integrate their code changes into a shared mainline several times a day. This allows for increased collaboration to point out project flaws and improve them quickly. 

                  Another way to perform agile testing is through test-driven development (TDD). In TDD, developers write unit tests before they write the code for a new feature. These unit tests define the requirements for the new feature.
                  
                  Once the developers write the code, they'll perform unit tests to make sure that everything works as expected.</P>
