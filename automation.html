                <P>Automated testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production. With automated testing, an organization can run specific software tests at a faster pace without human testers. Automated testing is best suited for large or repetitive test cases.

                  Automated software testing uses scripted sequences executed by testing tools. Automated testing tools examine the software, report outcomes and compare results with earlier test runs. An automated test script can be created once and then used repeatedly.
                  
                  An organization can apply automated tests to a broad range of cases, such as unit, application programming interface (API) and regression testing. The main benefit of automated software testing is that it simplifies much of the manual effort into a set of scripts. For example, if unit testing consumes a large percentage of a quality assurance (QA) team's resources, then this process should be evaluated as a candidate for automation.
                  
                  Automated tests can run repeatedly at any time of day and are an extremely important part of continuous testing, continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) software development practices.</P>
