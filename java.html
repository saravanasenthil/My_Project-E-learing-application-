                <P>While Java may be easy to use and easier to learn than other languages, the level of complexity to build, debug, and deploy Java apps has escalated to dizzying new heights. This is due to the exponential number of variables modern developers are faced with when developing web apps or mobile apps for common modern technologies such as music streaming or mobile cash payment apps. A developer writing a basic line-of-business app now needs to deal with multiple libraries, plugins, error logging and handling libraries, integrations with web services, and multiple languages such as C#, Java, HTML, and others. Understandably, there is an insatiable demand for any tools that will streamline Java app development, saving the developers time and money.

                  Enter application frameworks—the large bodies of prewritten code that developers can use and add to their own code, as their needs dictate. These frameworks lighten the developer's load for almost any need—whether they're developing mobile and web apps or working with desktops and APIs. Frameworks make creating apps quicker, easier, and more secure by providing reusable code and tools to help tie the different elements of a software development project all together.
                  
                  Here's where Spring comes in: Spring is an open-source project that provides a streamlined, modular approach for creating apps with Java. The family of Spring projects began in 2003 as a response to the complexities of early Java development and provides support for developing Java apps. The name, Spring, alone usually refers to the application framework itself or the entire group of projects, or modules. Java Spring Boot is one specific module that is built as an extension of the Spring framework.
                  
                  So, with that background on how the Spring framework, Spring Boot, and Java work together, here's the definition of Spring Boot—the tool that streamlines and speeds up web app and microservices development within the Java framework, Spring.</P>
